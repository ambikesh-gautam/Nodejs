#### What is node js?
Node.js is like a superhero playground for JavaScript. It runs JavaScript outside web browsers, handles many tasks at once, and lets you use the latest JavaScript tricks without waiting for updates. If you know JavaScript for websites, you can use it with Node.js too, no new language needed!
